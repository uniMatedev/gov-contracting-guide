/01-sole-proprietorship.md)

**Simplest structure is a sole proprietorship** ➡️ one individual owns the company 

**History** 📜 goes back to ancient traders operating alone

**Inherent option** ✅ for all US citizens, no separate registration

**You and the business are one** 🤝 use SSN for taxes, no protection

**Serious risks due to no business entity separation**

**No business entity protections** 

- You are personally liable for all debts and legal/tax responsibilities. Your personal assets can be seized.

**No personal asset protection**

- Business losses, lawsuits, etc. can consume personal assets like bank accounts, house, cars.

**Challenging to raise investment** 

- Most investors avoid investing in sole proprietorships.

**No continuity if you pass away**

- The business dies with you since there are no shares to transfer.


While sole proprietorships provide ease of setup, they lack key liability and continuity protections. Be sure to strongly evaluate risks before using this structure. 

**Assets & liabilities intermingled** 💰 between personal & business

**Easy to form and operate** 🚀 but unlimited liability exposure  

**Can transform later into LLC** 🦋 for liability protections & growth

**Good starting point to validate business idea quickly** 🎯
